1. Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics summarise and describe the main characteristics of a dataset.
Key Measures and Real-World Examples
a. Measures of Central Tendency
1. Mean (Average)
Formula:
Mean = ΣX / n
Example:
Monthly sales (in units) for a store: [120, 150, 180, 200, 250]
Calculation:
Mean = (120 + 150 + 180 + 200 + 250) / 5 = 180
Interpretation: The store sells an average of 180 units per month.
2. Median
Example:
Sales data: [120, 150, 180, 200, 250]
Sorted order: [120, 150, 180, 200, 250]
The middle value is 180.
3. Mode
The most frequent value in the dataset.
Example:
Customer satisfaction ratings: [4, 4, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 4]
Mode = 4 (most frequent).
b. Measures of Dispersion
   1. Range
Formula:
Range = Maximum Value - Minimum Value
Example:
Sales data: [120, 150, 180, 200, 250]
Range = 250 - 120 = 130
   2. Variance and Standard Deviation
Variance Formula:
Variance (σ²) = Σ(Xᵢ - 𝑋̄)² / n
Standard Deviation Formula:
Standard Deviation (σ) = √Variance
Example:
Daily temperatures: [30, 32, 34, 36, 38]
      * Mean = 34
      * Variance = [(30 - 34)² + (32 - 34)² + (34 - 34)² + (36 - 34)² + (38 - 34)²] / 5 = 8
      * Standard Deviation = √8 = 2.83


2. Inferential Statistics
Inferential statistics help draw conclusions about a population based on sample data.
Key Concepts and Real-World Examples
a. Hypothesis Testing
      * Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no difference/effect.
      * Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ): There is a difference/effect.
Example:
Does a new marketing strategy increase sales?
      * Sales before strategy: [200, 210, 215, 220, 230]
      * Sales after strategy: [250, 260, 270, 280, 300]
Interpretation: If p < 0.05, the difference is statistically significant.
b. Confidence Intervals (CI)
Formula:
CI = 𝑋̄ ± Z × (σ / √n)
Example:
      * Sample mean = 180, Std Dev = 15, n = 25, Z = 1.96
      * CI = 180 ± 1.96 × (15 / √25)
      * CI = (174.12, 185.88)


3. Probability
Probability quantifies the likelihood of events.
Key Concepts and Real-World Examples
a. Simple Probability
Example:
A bag contains 5 red, 3 blue, and 2 green balls.
      * Total balls = 5 + 3 + 2 = 10
      * Probability (P) = Favourable Outcomes / Total Outcomes
      * P(Blue) = 3 / 10 = 0.3


b. Conditional Probability
Formula:
P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)
Example:
A factory produces 60% A-grade items and 40% B-grade items. If 5% of A-grade and 10% of B-grade items are defective, what is the probability that a defective item is A-grade?
We are given:
      * P(A) = 0.60 (probability that an item is A-grade)
      * P(B) = 0.40 (probability that an item is B-grade)
      * P(D | A) = 0.05 (probability that an A-grade item is defective)
      * P(D | B) = 0.10 (probability that a B-grade item is defective)
We want to find P(A | D), the probability that a defective item is A-grade.
Bayes' Theorem:
Bayes' Theorem states:
P(A | D) = (P(D | A) * P(A)) / P(D)
Where:
      * P(A | D) is the probability that the item is A-grade given that it is defective.
      * P(D | A) is the probability that an A-grade item is defective.
      * P(A) is the probability that an item is A-grade.
      * P(D) is the total probability that an item is defective.
To calculate P(D) (the total probability of a defective item), we use the law of total probability:
P(D) = P(D | A) * P(A) + P(D | B) * P(B)
Step 1: Calculate P(D)
P(D) = (0.05 * 0.60) + (0.10 * 0.40) P(D) = 0.03 + 0.04 P(D) = 0.07
Step 2: Apply Bayes' Theorem
Now, we can calculate P(A | D):
P(A | D) = (0.05 * 0.60) / 0.07 P(A | D) = 0.03 / 0.07 P(A | D) ≈ 0.4286
Conclusion:
The probability that a defective item is A-grade is approximately 0.4286 or 42.86%.


c. Bayes’ Theorem
Formula:
P(A | B) = [P(B | A) × P(A)] / P(B)
4. Frequency Distribution
Frequency distribution shows how often each value occurs.
Example: Exam scores: [70, 80, 90, 70, 80, 90, 90, 100, 70]


Score   Frequency
  70                3
  80                2
  90                3
 100               1
